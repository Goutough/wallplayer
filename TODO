BUG: vid doesn't repaint in pause mode.
BUG: next file isn't being loaded in certain cases

status line (small!):
  filename
  next filename
  speed (1x, 2x...)
  pos (+numbers)
  volume (+numbers)

tech demo:
  * minimal ui
  * full status line
  * fix focus issues
  * slowdown/speedup
  * mute on speed change/unmute on return to ~1x
  * fwd/back slow/fast


* qgridlayout for sliders
* show upcoming file
* rubberbands (QSplitter)
* favorite clip
* command line args
* playlist management
* global playlist
* lower volume of background vids (ratio preference) when switching to single fullscreen

* align up to 4 players automatically
* bg color picker

* find continuations smartly (eg. DISC1/2.avi)
